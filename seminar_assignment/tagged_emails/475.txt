   It  has been five years since I stopped working on Andrew, so the freedom
   of information act -- along with the passing from power of several people
   --  allows  me  to  tell  some  candid stories about it</sentence>.<sentence>In 1983, the ITC
   started and grew to about 30 people</sentence>.<sentence>Eight were IBMers, ten  or  so  were
   newly  minted  Ph.D.s  from  our  very  own  department</sentence>.<sentence>We built Andrew,
   partially in the model of Spice and the Alto  system</sentence>.<sentence>It  achieved  some
   real  successes  but  didn't accomplish all that we'd hoped</sentence>.<sentence>Much of the
   problem was intrinsic to the way the world is, compared to how we thought
   it   was</sentence>.<sentence>I   often  meet  people  who  still  have  some  of  my  1982
   misperceptions</sentence>.<sentence>I will reconsider some of the early,  crucial  decisions  of  the  Andrew
   project  related  to  wiring,  protocols, workstations, file systems, and
   software</sentence>.<sentence>I'll assess the impact of Andrew on education and discuss  what
   IBM  and  CMU  ultimately  got  out  of  it</sentence>.<sentence>I will argue that UNIX, the
   Macintosh, and Electronic Mail will not survive to the next century</sentence>.<sentence>Finally, I'll offer eight opinions that computer scientists  who  venture
   into the real world should consider:
      1</sentence>.<sentence>Slowness Kills</sentence>.<sentence>2</sentence>.<sentence>Big, integrated systems lose</sentence>.<sentence>3</sentence>.<sentence>Virtual << Real</sentence>.<sentence>4</sentence>.<sentence>Programmer productivity is not so important</sentence>.<sentence>5</sentence>.<sentence>Technology transfer rarely works</sentence>.<sentence>6</sentence>.<sentence>Engineers don't buy; they log roll</sentence>.<sentence>7</sentence>.<sentence>Industrial funding is difficult</sentence>.<sentence>8</sentence>.<sentence>2nd System < 1st System < 3rd System</sentence>.</paragraph>
