 Title:    Control Strategies for Intermittent Dynamic Tasks

Running and juggling are examples of intermittent dynamic tasks</sentence>.<sentence>That

is, they require a manipulator alternately to be in contact with and

out of contact with another object, and the relative velocity at

contact is large</sentence>.<sentence>During the noncontact, or "ballistic" phase, the

manipulator loses the ability to control some of the degrees of freedom

of the overall system</sentence>.<sentence>The ballistic phase ends with an impact as

contact is re-established</sentence>.<sentence>The general control strategy for a

manipulator faced with such a task is two-fold</sentence>.<sentence>During the contact

phase, the manipulator must establish appropriate initial conditions

for the ballistic phase</sentence>.<sentence>During the ballistic phase, it must prepare

for the inevitable impact</sentence>.<sentence>How well do established control laws for running and juggling fit with

this idea of alternately establishing initial conditions and preparing

for impact</sentence>?<sentence>I'll discuss Marc Raibert's control law for running that

decomposes the problem along the degrees of freedom of the mechanism,

and Martin Buhler's use of a "mirror" algorithm for juggling</sentence>.<sentence>----------

Refreshments will be served from 3:15-3:30</sentence>.<sentence>Discussion and questions:  4:30-5:00</sentence>.<sentence>Everyone in the CMU community is invited to attend</sentence>.<sentence>---------</sentence>-</paragraph>
