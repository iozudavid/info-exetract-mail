 SPEAKER: PAUL S. HECKBERT, Computer Science Dept., Carnegie Mellon Univ</sentence>.<sentence>TITLE: FILTERS FOR IMAGE RESAMPLING

A common problem in image processing is resampling a raster image</sentence>.<sentence>This task crops up when removing distortions from satellite images and

when performing texture mapping in computer graphics, for example</sentence>.<sentence>Careful filtering must be done during resampling or the results will

appear blocky or show aliasing</sentence>.<sentence>Traditionally, most research in

resampling has addressed special cases</sentence>.<sentence>Often, the class of mappings

is restricted to be affine (translation, rotation, and scaling), in

which case the filter is space invariant</sentence>.<sentence>Furthermore, filters are

often designed for interpolation (upsampling) only or decimation

(downsampling) only</sentence>.<sentence>In this talk, we develop a unified theory for image resampling filters,

which subsumes previous methods for affine mappings, interpolation, and

decimation</sentence>.<sentence>The theory describes the space variant filter for

resampling a multidimensional signal according to an arbitrary mapping

without aliasing</sentence>.<sentence>A simple, fast approximation technique employing

elliptical Gaussian filters will be demonstrated</sentence>.<sentence>Refreshments Will be served by 3:15pm</sentence>*</paragraph>
