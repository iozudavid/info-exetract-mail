 ABSTRACT: We will demonstrate the sytem "automata" that implements

 finite state machines</sentence>.<sentence>The system consists of a Mathematica package

 together with a special purpose calculator that communicate via

 MathLink</sentence>.<sentence>Most of the standard operations on finite state machines

 are implemented, including the computation of syntactic semigroups and

 their decomposition into D-classes</sentence>.<sentence>Documentation for the system is

 available in the form of Mathematica notebooks as well as in printed

 form</sentence>.<sentence>The "automata" package has been used as a teaching tool in a

 standard graduate course on automata theory</sentence>.<sentence>The finite state machine

 calculator can also operate independently of Mathematica, and is

 helpful in the study of linear cellular automata</sentence>.<sentence>Recent versions of Mathematica are equipped with MathLink, a high-

level communications protocol that allows one to connect external

programs to a Mathematica kernel</sentence>.<sentence>Probably the most useful aspect of

MathLink is the fact that it enables one to use Mathematica as a

frontend to a special purpose program</sentence>.<sentence>Mathematica can then be

employed to display, manipulate and document the data generated by the

external program</sentence>.<sentence>After the lecture, Prof. Sutner will be glad to demonstrate and

discuss the use of MathLink and his "automata" package.</sentence> </paragraph>
