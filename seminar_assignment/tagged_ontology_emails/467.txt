 Topic<algebra>:     Algorithms for Square Roots of Graphs

The {\em kth power} of a graph  G = (V, E), written G^k,

is defined to be the graph having V as its vertex set with

vertices u, v adjacent in G^k if and only if

there exists a path of length at most k between them</sentence>.<sentence>Similarly, graph H has a {\em kth root} G if G^k = H.

Powers of graphs have several interesting properties</sentence>.<sentence>For example, the square of any biconnected graph and the

cube of any connected graph is hamiltonian</sentence>.<sentence>In this talk, we present algorithms to find a square

root G of a graph G^2 for the following special classes of graphs:

	Find G given G^2, where G is a tree, in O(m) time</sentence>.<sentence>Find G given G^2, where G^2 is planar, in O(n) time</sentence>.<sentence>Find G given G^2, where G is a subdivided graph, in O(m n) time</sentence>.<sentence>Finding square roots of subdivided graphs is equivalent to inverting

total graphs</sentence>.<sentence>In addition, we present several results on the complexity

of finding maximum cliques and hamiltonian cycles in powers of graphs</sentence>.<sentence>This is joint work with Yaw-Ling Lin</sentence>.<sentence>Host: Dana Scott

Appointments can be made through Lydia DeFilippo, x3063, lydia@cs.cmu.edu</sentence>.<sentence>Steve Skiena will be at CMU Monday, January 13, and Tuesday, February 14</sentence>.</paragraph>
